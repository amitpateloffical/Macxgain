# Market Hours Messages Completely Removed - 24/7 Trading

## 🎯 **Problem Solved**

The user was still seeing market hours messages like:
- "Trade exit available during market hours (9:15 AM - 3:30 PM IST)"
- "Market is Currently Closed"
- Market hours restrictions

## ✅ **What I Fixed**

### **1. Backend Market Checks Disabled**
```php
// app/Http/Controllers/AITradingController.php

// executeTrade method - Market check disabled
/*
if (!$this->isMarketOpen()) {
    return response()->json([
        'success' => false,
        'message' => 'Trading is only allowed during market hours (9:15 AM - 3:30 PM IST, Monday-Friday)',
        'market_status' => 'CLOSED'
    ], 400);
}
*/

// exitTrade method - Market check disabled
/*
if (!$this->isMarketOpen()) {
    return response()->json([
        'success' => false,
        'message' => 'Trade exit is only allowed during market hours (9:15 AM - 3:30 PM IST, Monday-Friday)',
        'market_status' => 'CLOSED'
    ], 400);
}
*/
```

### **2. Frontend Messages Updated**
```javascript
// resources/js/src/views/AdminSide/AITradingSession.vue

// OLD: Market closed notice
<div v-if="!marketStatus.is_open" class="market-notice">
  <h3>Market is Currently Closed</h3>
  <p>Normal market hours: Monday to Friday, 9:15 AM - 3:30 PM IST</p>
</div>

// NEW: 24/7 Trading enabled notice
<div class="trading-enabled-notice">
  <h3>🚀 Trading Enabled 24/7</h3>
  <p><strong>Trading is enabled 24/7 for testing purposes! You can trade anytime!</strong></p>
  <p class="notice-sub">Normal market hours: Monday to Friday, 9:15 AM - 3:30 PM IST (for reference only)</p>
</div>
```

### **3. Updated CSS Styling**
```css
/* OLD: Red warning style */
.market-notice {
  background: linear-gradient(145deg, #2a1a1a, #1a0f0f);
  border: 2px solid rgba(255, 68, 68, 0.3);
  color: #ff4444;
}

/* NEW: Green success style */
.trading-enabled-notice {
  background: linear-gradient(145deg, #1a2a1a, #0f1a0f);
  border: 2px solid rgba(34, 197, 94, 0.3);
  color: #22c55e;
