# Exit Trade 24/7 Enabled - Market Hours Removed

## 🎯 **Problem Identified**

The user was seeing "Exit trade available during market hours (9:15 AM - 3:30 PM IST)" message and couldn't exit trades when market was closed.

## ✅ **Root Cause**

The issue was in the frontend `AITradingOrders.vue` file:
- **Exit Button**: Was disabled when `!marketStatus.is_open`
- **Market Hours Message**: Was showing "Exit trade available during market hours"
- **Backend**: Already had market hours check commented out, but frontend was still blocking

## 🔧 **What I Fixed**

### **1. Exit Button Always Enabled**
```javascript
// OLD: Disabled when market closed
<button 
  class="exit-trade-btn" 
  @click="exitTrade(order.id)"
  :disabled="exitingTrade === order.id || !marketStatus.is_open"
  :title="!marketStatus.is_open ? 'Trade exit only allowed during market hours' : ''"
>

// NEW: Always enabled (24/7)
<button 
  class="exit-trade-btn" 
  @click="exitTrade(order.id)"
  :disabled="exitingTrade === order.id"
  :title="'Exit trade - 24/7 trading enabled'"
>
```

### **2. Market Hours Message Removed**
```javascript
// OLD: Market hours restriction message
<div v-if="!marketStatus.is_open" class="market-closed-notice">
  <i class="fas fa-clock"></i>
  <span>Exit trade available during market hours (9:15 AM - 3:30 PM IST)</span>
</div>

// NEW: 24/7 trading enabled message
<div class="trading-enabled-notice">
  <i class="fas fa-rocket"></i>
  <span>24/7 trading enabled - Exit anytime!</span>
</div>
```

### **3. CSS Updated**
```css
// OLD: Orange warning color
.market-closed-notice {
  color: #ffaa00;
}

// NEW: Green success color
.trading-enabled-notice {
  color: #22c55e;
  font-weight: 500;
}
```
